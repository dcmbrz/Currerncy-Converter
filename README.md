This Python script is designed to convert a given base currency into multiple currencies using the Free Currency API. Here's how it works:

1. It imports the requests module for making HTTP requests.

2. It defines the API key required to access the Free Currency API and constructs the base URL for API requests.

3. It defines a list of currencies to which the base currency will be converted.

4. The convert_currency function takes a base currency as input. It constructs the API request URL with the provided base currency and the list of currencies to convert, sends a GET request to the API, and returns the JSON response containing the conversion rates. It handles exceptions such as invalid currencies by printing a message and returning None.

5. A loop is started to continuously prompt the user to enter a base currency. If the user enters 'q', the loop breaks and the program exits. Otherwise, it calls the convert_currency function with the provided base currency. If the currency is invalid, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

6. If the currency is valid, it iterates over the response data and prints the currency ticker symbol along with its conversion rate.

This script allows users to easily convert a base currency into multiple currencies using the Free Currency API.
